# Two Pointers Pattern

The two pointers pattern is a common technique used to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists. It involves using two pointers to traverse the data structure, which can help optimize the solution by reducing the time complexity.

## Explanation

The two pointers technique can be applied in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Finding pairs**: Identifying pairs of elements that meet certain criteria (e.g., sum to a specific value).
2. **Rearranging elements**: Moving elements around based on certain conditions (e.g., separating even and odd numbers).
3. **Merging sorted arrays**: Efficiently merging two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

## Examples

### Example 1: Pair with Target Sum

Given an array of integers and a target sum, find if there are two numbers in the array that add up to the target sum.

**Approach**: Use one pointer at the beginning and another at the end of the array. Adjust the pointers based on the sum of the elements they point to.

### Example 2: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length of the array.

**Approach**: Use one pointer to iterate through the array and another pointer to track the position of unique elements.

## Conclusion

The two pointers pattern is a versatile and efficient technique that can significantly reduce the complexity of solving problems involving linear data structures. Understanding how to implement this pattern can enhance problem-solving skills in coding interviews and competitive programming.
