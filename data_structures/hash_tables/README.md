# README for Hash Tables

This directory contains information and examples related to hash table data structures. Hash tables are a fundamental data structure that provides efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval. They are widely used in various applications, including databases, caches, and sets.

## Key Concepts

- **Hash Function**: A function that converts an input (or 'key') into a fixed-size string of bytes. The output is typically a hash code that is used to index the hash table.
- **Collision Resolution**: Techniques to handle situations where two keys hash to the same index in the hash table. Common methods include chaining and open addressing.
- **Load Factor**: A measure of how full the hash table is, calculated as the number of entries divided by the number of buckets. A higher load factor can lead to more collisions.

## Examples

1. **Basic Operations**:
   - Insertion
   - Deletion
   - Searching

2. **Use Cases**:
   - Implementing associative arrays
   - Caching data
   - Counting frequencies of elements
