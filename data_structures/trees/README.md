# README for Tree Data Structures

This directory contains information and examples related to tree data structures, which are a fundamental concept in computer science. Trees are used to represent hierarchical data and are essential for various algorithms and data manipulation techniques.

## Overview of Tree Data Structures

A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a root node, and every node can have zero or more child nodes. The main characteristics of trees include:

- **Root**: The top node of the tree.
- **Leaf**: A node that has no children.
- **Height**: The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.
- **Depth**: The length of the path from the root to a specific node.

## Common Types of Trees

1. **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child contains values less than the parent node, and the right child contains values greater than the parent node.
3. **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree.
4. **Red-Black Tree**: A balanced binary search tree with additional properties to ensure balance.
5. **N-ary Tree**: A tree where each node can have at most N children.

## Examples and Problems

This section will include various examples and problems related to tree data structures, including:

- Traversal methods (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
- Finding the height of a tree
- Searching for a value in a tree
- Inserting and deleting nodes in a binary search tree
- Balancing trees
