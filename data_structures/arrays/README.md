# Array Data Structures

This directory contains information and examples related to array data structures, which are fundamental to many algorithms and data manipulation tasks.

## Overview

Arrays are a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. They are used to store multiple items of the same type together. The main characteristics of arrays include:

- **Fixed Size**: The size of an array is defined at the time of declaration and cannot be changed.
- **Index-Based Access**: Elements in an array can be accessed using their index, which allows for efficient retrieval.
- **Homogeneous Elements**: All elements in an array are of the same data type.

## Common Operations

1. **Insertion**: Adding an element at a specific index.
2. **Deletion**: Removing an element from a specific index.
3. **Traversal**: Accessing each element in the array.
4. **Searching**: Finding an element in the array (linear search, binary search).
5. **Sorting**: Arranging the elements in a specific order (ascending or descending).

## Examples

- **Finding the Maximum Element**: A simple algorithm to find the maximum value in an array.
- **Reversing an Array**: An example of how to reverse the elements of an array in place.
- **Merging Two Sorted Arrays**: Demonstrating how to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

## Conclusion

Understanding arrays is crucial for solving many algorithmic problems on platforms like LeetCode. This directory will provide various examples and solutions to common array-related problems.
