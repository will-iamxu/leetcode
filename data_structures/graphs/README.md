# Graph Data Structures

This directory contains information and examples related to graph data structures. Graphs are a fundamental data structure used to represent relationships between objects. They consist of vertices (or nodes) and edges (connections between the nodes).

## Topics Covered

- **Graph Representation**: Different ways to represent graphs, including adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.
- **Graph Traversal Algorithms**: 
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: 
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: 
  - Prim's Algorithm
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
- **Cycle Detection**: Techniques to detect cycles in directed and undirected graphs.

## Examples

- Implementing a graph using an adjacency list.
- Performing DFS and BFS on a graph.
- Finding the shortest path between two nodes.
- Constructing a minimum spanning tree from a graph.

## Usage
